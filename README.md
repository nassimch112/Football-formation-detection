# Football Tactical Analysis System

This project is designed to analyze football highlight videos, generating insights such as player heatmaps and formation snapshots. The system utilizes computer vision techniques to detect players, classify them into teams based on jersey colors, and visualize their movements throughout the video.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/football-analysis.git
   cd football-analysis
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Download the YOLOv8 weights and place them in the `models` directory.

## Usage Guidelines

- To run the analysis, execute the `main.py` file:
  ```
  python main.py
  ```

- Modify the configuration settings in `src/utils/config.py` to adjust paths and parameters as needed.

## Overview of Functionalities

- **Video Loading**: Load and extract frames from highlight videos.
- **Player Detection**: Utilize YOLOv8 to detect players in each frame.
- **Team Classification**: Classify players into teams based on jersey colors using clustering techniques.
- **Position Tracking**: Track player positions across frames and save relevant data.
- **Heatmap Generation**: Create heatmaps visualizing player presence for each team.
- **Formation Overlay**: Overlay formation snapshots on selected frames, illustrating team structures.
